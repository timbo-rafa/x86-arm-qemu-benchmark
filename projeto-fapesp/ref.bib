% second generation simulators have reduced the expansion factor to
% about 10. They achieve this improvement primarily by saving the
% translations of individual guest instructions and the n reusing the
% translations when the instructions are re-executed. The cost of
% translating an instruction is thus amortized over multiple executions
% of that instruction .
